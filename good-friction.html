        <p style="font-size: 1.4rem; color: #666; font-weight: 300; max-width: 65ch;">
          There is a fundamental conflict of affinity between movement and gathering. We cannot prioritise movement efficiency without destroying community as moments of gathering, we cannot support gathering without creating movement efficiency. One consideration is the strategic re-introduction of friction between these two states - moving and stopping.

          <h3>1. The Conflict of Affinity</h3>
            <p>
                In <em>Urban Design Made by Humans</em> and <em>Making Architecture Through Being Human</em>, we identify a geometric reality that algorithmic planning often ignores: the incompatibility of the line (movement) and the circle (gathering).
            </p>
            <p>
                The line demands continuity; the circle demands boundaries. When a line of movement cuts through a circle of gathering, the affinity of the circle is broken. The container is breached, and the social potential evaporates.
            </p>
             <blockquote>
                "Movement and gathering have conflicting affinities. The primary affinity of movement is continuity (flow), while the primary affinity of gathering is containment (boundary). When movement dominates, gathering becomes impossible.<br><span style="font-size: 0.8em; font-style: normal;">— <em>Urban Design Made by Humans</em> (2022)</span>

           <h3>2. The Algorithmic Drive for "Smoothness"</h3>
            <p>
                Modern digital tools (and modern city planning) are obsessed with "frictionless" experiences. They optimize for speed, throughput, and the removal of obstacles. In <em>The Hidden Lives of Algorithms</em>, we see that this optimization is actually a form of social erasure.
            </p>
            <p>
                By removing the "friction" of the physical world—the pauses, the textures, the delays—we remove the very moments where social negotiation occurs.
            </p>
            <blockquote>
           "Efficiency is a reduction of complexity. The algorithm seeks the path of least resistance, smoothing over the 'texture' of reality that provides the anchor points for human memory and interaction."

            <h3>3. Strategic Inefficiency</h3>
            <p>
                Efficiency is a good thing but so is a little slowness, attention, and moments of pause. What matters mostly is choice along with a little <em>good friction</em>, the strategic placement of the circles (moments of gathering) within lines as vectors of movement.

                <strong>Design Strategies for Friction:</strong>
                <ul>
                    
                    <li>
                        <strong>Disruption of Pattern:</strong> 
                        We distinguish place from space through <em>difference</em>. By inserting "disruptions in patterns, or moments of contrast," we break automatic processing and support the user in their cognitive engagement with the environment.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Interiority (The Recess):</strong> 
                        Friction requires stopping. We must design "shapes, recesses, and locations where a sense of interiority should occur." These physical indentations in the efficient line create the "feelings of shelter, protection, and a sense of safety" necessary for social pause.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Compartmentalisation:</strong> 
                        Meaning is not just flow; it is "containment, proximity, adjacency, and contiguity." We create friction by defining boundaries that separate the <em>everywhere</em> of generic space from the <em>somewhere</em> of the human interaction.
                    </li>
